## Project 1: Repayment function for credit card in PINGAN bank
Description: Regarding repayment, although the page may appear simple, it contains a lot of internal logic. For example, the user interface adapts to different user types, such as those using dual-currency credit cards. Additionally, based on the user's repayment time, the system guides them to set up a repayment plan and receive repayment discounts. Due to the involvement of fund transfers, the server-side requires strict validation.
